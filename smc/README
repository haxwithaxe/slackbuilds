smc (Secret Maryo Chronicles)

Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform game 
with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such as Super 
Mario Bros.  It uses the platform independent library SDL and, since 
version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated Graphics Renderer. The game is 
developed in C++.

** REQUIRES **
To compile this game you will need OpenGL (with hardware acceleration 
enabled) and CEGUI.  Make sure CEGUI is compiled *WITHOUT* DevIL support 
(or just make sure it is not the default image codec) and *WITH* either 
FreeImage or SILLY codec support (FreeImage is the most recommended choice).  
Also, the background music for this game, if desired, must be installed as 
a separate package.  SlackBuilds for the music pack, FreeImage, and CEGUI 
can all be found on SlackBuilds.org.

Please see readme-linux.txt in the docs directory of the source for more
information on this software.
