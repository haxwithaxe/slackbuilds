# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rtl-sdr: rtl-sdr (rtl-sdr codebase)
rtl-sdr:
rtl-sdr: DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek RTL2832U can be used as a cheap 
rtl-sdr: SDR, since the chip allows transferring the raw I/Q samples to the 
rtl-sdr: host, which is officially used for DAB/DAB+/FM demodulation. The 
rtl-sdr: possibility of this has been discovered by Eric Fry (History and 
rtl-sdr: Discovery of RTLSDR). Antti Palosaari has not been involved in 
rtl-sdr: development of rtl-sdr.
