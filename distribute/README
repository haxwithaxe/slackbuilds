distribute is a fork of the setuptools project.
Python 2 or 3 slackbuild
Set PYVER in the environment to "3" inorder to build for Python3

Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method for
working with Python module distributions.

For those who may wonder why they should switch to Distribute over
Setuptools, it's quite simple:

- Distribute is a drop-in replacement for Setuptools.
- The code is actively maintained, and has over 10 commiters.
- Distribute offers Python 3 support!

If you have pysetuptools installed, you need to remove it before installing
this package.
